## Hands-on Lab - Earth Explorer
In this hands-on lab, we will be building a Xamarin application that will display a list of interest locations and its location on a map. This app will target iOS and Android.

#### Get Started
1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**
2. Go to **File** > **New** > **Project**
3. Navigate to **Other Project Types** > **Visual Studio Solutions** and create a **Blank Solution** called **EarthExplorer**
4. We are going to add 3 projects into this solution.
5. In the **Solution Explorer**, **right click** on **Earth Explorer** > **Add** > **New Project**
6. Navigate to **Visual C#** > **.NET Standard** > **Class Library (.NET Standard)**
7. Name this project **EarthExplorer.Core** and click **OK**
8. In the Solution Explorer right click on **Earth Explorer** > **Add** > **New Project**
9. Navigate to **Visual C#** > **Android** > **Android App (Xamarin)**
10. Name this project **EarthExplorer.Droid** and click **OK**
11. Select **Blank App** and click **OK**
12. Add another project by going to the Solution Explorer. **Right click** on **EarthExplorer** > **Add** > **New Project**
13. Navigate to **Visual C#** > **iPhone & iPad** > **iOS App (Xamarin)**
14. Name this project **EarthExplorer.iOS** and click **OK**
15. Select **Single View App** and click **OK**

You should see a solution that contains 3 projects as such:

* EarthExplorer.Core - Portable Class Library that will have all shared code (model, views, and view models).
*  EarcthExplorer.Droid - Xamarin. Droid application
*  EarthExplorer.iOS - Xamarin.iOS application

#### Building the shared logic
In the **EarthExplorer (Portable)** project, a default class **MyClass** has been created.

Open the class, delete **everything**, and use this code

In the **solution explorer**, rename **MyClass.cs** to **PointOfInterest.cs** as a form of good practice

We're now done with our business logic!
