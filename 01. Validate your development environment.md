## Validate your development environment
### Steps
#### Open the Solution in Visual Studio on Windows
1. Open the **TaskyPro.sln** solution contained in the **[Exercise 1/TaskyPro](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/SP_XamarinWorkshop/tree/master/Exercise%201/TaskyPro)** folder. This solution contains several projects, take a moment to familiarize yourself with each one.

	| Project     | Description          | 
	| ------------|:-------------:|
	| Tasky.Core  | This is a *Portable Class Library* which contains the code that is shared across all the platforms (iOS, Android and Windows). The code is written in C# and is where the business logic and data models used in the application are stored. |
	| Tasky.Droid | This is the Xamarin.Android project which can be deployed onto an Android device or emulator. Use this project to test your Android setup.      |
	| Tasky.iOS   | This is the Xamarin.iOS project which can be deployed onto an iOS device or simulator. Use this project to test your iOS setup.     |
 2. Select which version (iOS or Android) you want to run by **right-clicking** on the project and selecting **Set as Startup Project**  from the context menu. The startup project is always shown in **Bold** text in the Solution Explorer.
 3. Set the **Build Configuration** to be **Debug** and select a simulator or emulator from the drop down in the Toolbar.
 4. Build and run the application by clicking the **Play** button in the Toolbar.
 5. The application should launch and display and empty task list. You can add new tasks through the **(+)** button, and tap on entered tasks to display details.
 6. Repeat the same steps for the other environments(s) you want to test on -  change the startup project, build and run the application.
